# Portfolio Website of Shashank Chamarty

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## More info:
My website has three tabs: home page, projects, and about me

### Home page animaton
Home page has a really cool introduction about me, and what I like. Even though it is a regular text, I have used CSS animations to make it look even better!

### Projects
This tab of the website includes various projects I have been working on.

### Deployment
This website is live at:
[https://shashank.junebase.com]

Junebase our private server that I use to host applications.
