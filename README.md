# Portfolio Website: Shashank Chamarty

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects and technical skills.

## Credits & Acknowledgements
This project is a customized fork of the [my-website](https://github.com/SaiChamarty/my-website) repository by [Sai Chamarty](https://github.com/SaiChamarty). I have built upon his original architecture to include personalized animations and project showcases.
